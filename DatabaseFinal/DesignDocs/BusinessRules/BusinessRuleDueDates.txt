ACTION TAKEN

Remove the DueDate as it is a calculated field. These numbers will be implemented in the application as we evaluate calculated fields.

NOTES: These numbers are taken from the standard of the New York Public Library systems, since we took too long to ask the client :(.
This is true for all submitted business rules with "magic numbers" like this.
