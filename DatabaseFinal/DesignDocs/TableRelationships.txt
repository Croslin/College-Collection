Media
The Media table connects to four other tables in the Therpston Library database.  These tables are Books, Movies, MediaReservations, and ClubMedia.  The connections to Books and Movies act the same as one another, that is the connection between the two is present because each piece of media in the library, books and movies, has a unique ID to identify it called a MediaID which acts as a primary key for this table.  This connection is 1:1 as each piece of media can only have one ID and vice versa.  This connection is  optional as while each media needs an ID and vice versa for the media table MediaID can be either a book or a movie but not both.  The connection to Media Reservations also uses the field MediaID and this connection from Media to Reservation is one to many with an unlimited amount of connections on the reservations end.  This is because a media can be rented out many times but there is only one media present in a reservation.  This connection is optional for the Media table as a piece of media doesn’t need to be rented out.  The last connection Media has is to the ClubMedia table which also uses the field MediaID.  This connection is one to many because multiple clubs can use a piece of media.  For the Media table the connection is optional as a media doesn’t need to be used by a club to be in the library.  

Books
The Books table's only connection is to media by using the field MediaID which is a foreign key to Books and a primary key to Media.  This connection is one to one as each Book can only have one MediaID.  This connection is also not optional for Books because each book needs an ID.

Movies
The Movies table’s connection is similar to the Books table’s connection.  There is only one and it is with the MediaID foreign key from the Media Table.  This connection is one to one because only one ID per book and this connection is not optional.

MediaReservations
This table is a linking table that connects to Media and Patrons.  It connects to Media using the foreign key MediaID.  This connection is one to many because while a media could have been reserved at different times, a reservation can only have one media.  This connection is not optional for reservations as in order to have a reservation a media needs to have been rented in the first place.  The connection this table has to Patrons is very similar being one to many.  It is connected using the foreign key PatronID which is the primary key of Patrons.  For MediaReservations this connection is not optional because in order for a media to be rented it needs someone to rent it.

Patrons
The Patrons table is connected to both the MediaReservations table and the ClubMembers table by way of the PatronID key. Both linking tables (the MediaReservations table and the ClubMembers table) use the PatronID field in the Patrons table to connect individual library patrons to their clubs and the media rentals that they have. The relationship between Patrons and MediaReservations is a one to many relationship from one patron to many possible media reservations. The PatronID must exist in the Patrons table and there can only be one patron attached to each entry in the MediaReservations table. Similarly with ClubMembers, this is a one-to-many relationship where the PatronID must exist in the Patrons table, and there can only be one patron attached to each entry in the ClubMembers table. Both of these relationships have a 0 or more degree of participation; there is no reasonable limit on the number of clubs or media rentals that one individual patron can be involved with. Since this is personal information, these relationships have a Cascading deletion rule for information safety purposes.

Clubs
The Clubs table is linked to both the ClubMembers and ClubMedia tables, which are linking tables with Patrons and Media, respectively. These relationships are both one to many relationships with mandatory involvement from the Clubs table and optional involvement in the ClubMembers and ClubMedia tables. These relationships additionally have a 0 or more degree of participation, since it makes sense for it to be possible that a club has no members or that a club has not designated a piece of media for use by the club, such as in the case that a club doesn’t use any media, like a club for meeting new people, or that a club has no members, like a newly formed club. Since it doesn’t make any sense to retain records of defunct clubs, these relationships both have a Cascade deletion rule.

ClubMembers
Both of ClubMembers’s relationships have been detailed above, but they are both typical linking table relationships that have a one to many constraint with optional participation in the ClubMembers table. One of these relationships is with Patrons and the other is with Clubs.

ClubMedia
Both of ClubMedia’s relationships have been detailed above, but they are both typical linking table relationships that have a one to many constraint with optional participation in the ClubMedia table. One of these relationships is with Media and the other is with Clubs.
